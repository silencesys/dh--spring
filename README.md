Spring is an Excel file viewer and analyzer. It allows you to filter your `.xslx` documents and generate charts based on the data contained in the documents. The app was developed for a project by Josef Vacek, who also provided the funding for the development of this app.

## Installation
Download the package for your OS and install or unzip the application.


<br>

## Development
The app uses [Vue CLI Plugin Electron Builder](https://nklayman.github.io/vue-cli-plugin-electron-builder/) thus can be developed as any other JavaScript application.

### Project setup
First, it is necessary to install all Node packages, thus run:
```
npm install
```

#### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
To preview the app during the development following command could be used:
```
npm run electron:serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
Before making PR, please try to build the app and run it again as some bugs can appear after building the application.
```
npm run electron:build
```
